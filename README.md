# Allocation of national carbon budgets to a sub-national level
Calculation of subnational carbon budgets budgets using both consumption- and production-based emissions approaches

### Overview
1. Calculate new set of national carbon budgets based on the approach from GEC 2022 article, using both production- and consumption-based emissions, for all countries.
2. Allocate national budgets for EU27 countries to subnational regions at NUTS-2 scale, differentiating between PBE budgets for emissions from ETS sectors, PBE budgets for emissions from sectors under ESR and CBE budgets as desscribed in the paper by Lackner et al. (2025): "Applying fairness in subnational carbon budget allcoations"
